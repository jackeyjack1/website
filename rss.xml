                <p>OK so first I use discord only from the browser (Ungoogled Chromium) because it helps at mitigating all the spyware and it should enheance its performance BUT discord is sooo bloated, soo full of javascript and malicious stuff that it still burn my cpu if I start to mess up with some graphic settings. Now the second part, the spyware issue, I think discord is one of the most harmful amongst all other spyware software because even privacy focused people are using it, and also because computer science university tend to only work with discord (and mail of couse :P) because tHaThS wHAt StuDenTs uSE. Well actually that's a positive/negative point because <i>everyone</i> are on discord so it's pretty easy to find interesting people, BUT AT WHAT COST. <br/> tldr: discord is super bloated and spies on you, but there are good community on it</p>
